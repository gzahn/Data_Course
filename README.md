# Data Analysis Course - Utah Valley University

This site serves as a repository for all class material.

The course [*website*](https://gzahn.github.io/data-course/) gives a tentative outline of the weekly topics to be covered. It also has assignments and plentiful links to outside resources to help you learn.

The code and data we use in class will be posted here so you have access to it.
Additionally, detailed assignment instructions will be here as they become available (see the Assignments directory).
*All assignments will be turned in on Canvas as well as your personal GitHub repository.*

The file *Syllabus.pdf* is the official course syllabus.
